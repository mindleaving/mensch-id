# mensch.ID TODO

## Bugs
- Can register multiple anonymous accounts linked to same mensch.ID, but only one password works. Desired behavior: Prohibit multiple anonymous accounts for same mensch.ID.
- External login redirects to /login
- Assigner accounts shown in account list for private user: Omit assigner accounts in list of accounts associated with mensch.ID

## Features
- Delete logins (and account when last login is deleted. Show confirmation dialogue)
